# Automated Modelling of Diameter Height Curves for Trees

The `dhcurve` package bundles a number of functions that allow to model 'Diameter Height Curves' starting from a dataset of tree measures (tree species, location, perimeter and height).  The final result is a dataset that provides an estimated height for each combination of tree species, location and perimeter, or a dataset that provides for each combination of tree species and location the paramaters A, B and C of the model curve $Height = A + B\log(Perimeter)+C\log(Perimeter)^2$.

The package is written in Dutch.
